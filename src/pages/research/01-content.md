### What we do

We focus on various facets of **Efficient AI** to make AI equally accessible to everyone. In particular, we are interested in achieving the favorable tradeoffs in terms of:
- Model accuracy
- Inference cost
- Training cost

### How we approach

We pursue this goal through identifying, understanding and harnessing the ***algorithmic biases*** of machine learning. Modern machine learning algorithms tend to be biased toward finding a very specific solution, instead of simply finding any solution which fits the training dataset well. Luckily, it turns out that we can steer ML algorithms in a way that the learned solution generalize well. However, it often comes at the cost of more expensive training or inference.

Through theories, we seek to characterize such tradeoffs; through algorithms, we seek to achieve Pareto-optimal points on the tradeoff curve.

### Research highlights

Here are some examples of our recent projects:

- **Speed, accuracy, and initialization.** We characterize how the initialization scale affects the generalizability and training speed of neural networks ([A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00827),[B](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sr5XaZzirA)).
- **Attention bias for Quantization.** We exploit the "attention sink" phenomenon to mitigate outliers in LLMs/VLMs, so that they can be quantized to low bitwidths ([A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04547), [B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12016)).
- **On-Device LMs with Auditory Commonsense.** We reveal that on-device LMs often lack auditory commonsense through our new benchmark, and develop methods to equip the models with such knowledge ([A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17641), [B](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.730/), [C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08199)).
- **Layer-adaptive Compression of Deep Nets.** We devise algorithms to compress neural networks in a way that reflects the distinct roles of each layers ([A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04348), [B](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H6ATjJ0TKdf)).
- **Neural codec for model weights.** We develop neural data compression algorithms for neural network weights, with applications in LLMs or neural fields ([A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11234), [B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05965), [C](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bBXCCSoVQZ), [D](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tn0PnRY877g))
